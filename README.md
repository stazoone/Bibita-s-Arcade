# Bibita-s-Arcade
  A small game made for my girlfriend's birthday containing several mini games most people are familliar with, such as Flappy Bird, Memory, Papa's Pizzeria, made using GDScript using the Godot 4 game engine.

  This is my first ever game, and my first time using Godot as well. This took me around 30 hours + several more for the (awful) assets used. Can't upload the executables for Windows/Linux as they are too big but below is a link to the itch.io page of the game. Using all the files in this repository, one can also create executables in the Godot Engine itself.
